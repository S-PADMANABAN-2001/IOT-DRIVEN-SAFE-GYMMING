# IOT-DRIVEN-SAFE-GYMMING

# Objective

Smart gym equipments for preventing injuries caused by weighted exercise movements and imbalances due to human error.

# Motivation

1.We have been influenced by the Fit India movement which became a nation-wide meta in India in encouraging people in mass for taking physical exercises as a priority concern in our daily lives(keeping in mind the corporate section people) 

2.In the growing IT world , people tend to work from 9to5 sitting in a sole place risking their health by not taking ailments in addition not taking fitness as serious deal which in turn results in obesity and its derivatives.

4.As the fear of getting injured by employing gym equipment while exercising sets an Obstacle in making it to action by a normal human being, it made us to think how can we eliminate this fear?

Henceforth , we decided to implement IOT on gym apparatus for the same. 



# Abstract
Smart gymming plays a vital role in eliminating human errors to some extent that can ensure the safety of the individuals having keen interest towards fitness training and health.Besides, it will rectify the mistakes while the workout is being performed and correct the postures while doing diverse weight training exercises.

In this project , we will be using microcontrollers which will be connected with movement sensors that will be connected to ball and socket joints to sense the movement of the bars thereby simultaneous adjustments is being done automatically depending on the requirements of the former.

Microcontroller along with the movement sensors will calculate the acceleration
and stop the exercise if the former goes out of control or the movement is rapid and it enables to former to stop , relax and recover until then and continue once again from where he left.
Henceforth, it will set a promising example that will motivate others to employ these exercises.
